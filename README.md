# katakana IME (katakana.js)

A *very* basic japanese IME (input method editor) which automatically converts romaji to Katakana (by default) or Hiragana.   
To write in Hiragana, just type the letter H (in uppercase), then delete it and you're ready to type in Hiragana. To go back to Katakana, repeat the same procedure but with the letter K this time.  
  
It has a couple of (language) flaws:

* Sometimes you have to type as a combo (?). eg: to type 'ナ' ('na' in katakana) you have to press the keys quickly, else it'll parse 'n' and 'a' as 'ン' and 'ア'.   
* There are some words that you can't type. eg: in hiragana, you can't type 'happyaku' or 'はっぴゃく', so please ignore this and just type '800' instead :-)
